# ttcopy: Trans-Terminal Copy/Paste

Provide copying and pasting within multiple hosts through the Web.

![Introduction Image](./img/ttcp_intro_img.png)

# Environment
  * zsh (tested ver: 4.3, 5.0)
  * bash (tested ver: 3.2, 4.2)

## Dependent commands
  * openssl
  * curl

# Installation
First of all, please prepare ID and Password **as you like**.
Be lazy! You are **NOT** required to register them on any services.
The data you copied can be pasted within the hosts having same ID/Password.

After that, set up `ttcopy` on the hosts which you want to make share same data.
Please follow the following instructions to install it.

## With [zplug](https://zplug.sh) (for zsh users)

If you are using zplug, it is easy and recommended way.
Add those lines to `.zshrc`.

```sh
# Set ID and Password you decided.
export TTCP_ID="your_id"
export TTCP_PASSWORD="your_password"

zplug "greymd/ttcopy"
```

That's all ðŸŽ‰.

## Manual Installation

If you are not using `zplug` (includeing bash users), follow below steps

#### 1. Clone repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/greymd/ttcopy.git ~/ttcopy
```

#### 2. Edit `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

Add following lines.

```sh
# Set ID and Password you decided.
export TTCP_ID="your_id"
export TTCP_PASSWORD="your_password"

source ~/ttcopy/ttcp_activate.sh
```

##### For advanced users

`ttcp_activate.sh` adds `ttcocpy/bin` to `$PATH`. Instead of using it, you can
copy `ttcopy/bin` and `ttcopy/lib` somewhere you want to place then make sure
`ttcopy/bin` be listed under `$PATH`.

For example,

```sh
cp -rf ~/ttcopy/bin ~/ttcopy/lib /usr/local

echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin" >> ~/.zshrc" # if you need
```

# Examples

### Copy & Paste within multiple hosts!

* Host1
```sh
$ echo foobar | ttcopy
```

* Host2
```sh
$ ttpaste
foobar
```

### Clip binary data.

* Host1
```sh
$ cat image.jpg | ttcopy
```

* Host2
```sh
$ ttpaste | file -
/dev/stdin: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
```
